        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <h5>As an IT graduate, I have hands-on experience in technical support, software development, and networking through internships and project work. I assisted in troubleshooting hardware and software issues, configured and maintained computer systems, and supported end-users in resolving technical concerns. I also gained exposure to web development, database management, and network setup, allowing me to apply both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. My background has strengthened my problem-solving, teamwork, and communication abilities, making me adaptable to different IT roles.</h5>
